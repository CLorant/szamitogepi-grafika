About
L.O.P.A.S was inspired by the early access roguelite game R.E.P.O.
The name follows a similar format, but instead of translating the
word "repossession", it translates as "theft".

Goal
The aim is to collect an arbitrary amount of items, which can be sold
at the end of the game at the collection point in the starting room.
The aim is to reach a certain value, but it is also possible to sell
items above this value. The difficulty is keeping the objects intact,
as they can be damaged or broken.
